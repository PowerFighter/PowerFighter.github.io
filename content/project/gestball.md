GestLib was a OpenCV based implementation of hand tracking with pose recognition.

To test the GestLib we also made a game called GestBall, where certain poses like 1-Finger,2-Finger triggered certain actions on the player character which was a bouncing ball.
Rendering was done using a spriterenderer on the DirectX API.
