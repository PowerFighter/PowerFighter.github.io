# Biography

Hi, My name is Nagarjuna (short form "Arjun"). I am currently a Gameplay / AI programmer at PixelOpus Studio , Sony Interactive Entertainment America. 


I was an avid gamer from the age of 10, when my Dad got me my first PC powered by a Pentium mmx chip. I started learning programming starting from LOGO , BASIC, JAVA and then C / C++.
Following my interest in computers , I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and Technology from Amrita University , Coimbatore, India. 
My final year project was making a game in which the player controls a ball using gestures. 

Following this I did my Masters in Entertainment technology at Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , USA. Here i learnt a lot about prototyping in the **"Building Virtual Worlds"** class taught by Jesse Schell and MK Haley. Here I worked on a variety of platforms like the Kinect, Wii-mote, HMD etc.

The Second semester i worked on a project called **"Strike Fortress"** with Electronic Arts at Redwood Shores, CA. Strike fortress was a tower defense WebGL game written entirely in Javascript.

The third  and fourth semesters i worked on two projects with Sony Computer Entertainment America. The first one being 4 prototypes on Playstation Vita using the Playstation Mobile SDK. The second one was a co-op project at the Sony Foster City Campus.

Soon after the co-op project, the **PixelOpus Studio** was formed with my team from Carnegie Mellon and some veterans from the gaming industry. We released Entwined after just 10 months of development. 

**Entwined** was definitely a unique project. It had a highly philosophical story. Combined with amazing visuals and music, it was a mesmerizing experience.
It was released on PS4,PS3 and Vita.You can find more details about this in the projects section. 
We also released a mobile version called **"Entwined Challenge"**, you can find this on the IOS and android app stores.

Overall I am interested in prototyping new gameplay concepts. I also love making different types of Game AI. 
I am also interested in non game AI including Deep learning and its applications.
I also love the optimization process and am always in the pursuit of optimized code (both datastructures and algorithms),

Thank you for visiting my site, If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at nagarjuna.varma@gmail.com.
