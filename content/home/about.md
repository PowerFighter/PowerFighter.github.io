# Biography

Hi, My name is Nagarjuna (short form "Arjun"). I am currently a Gameplay / AI programmer at PixelOpus Studio , Sony Interactive Entertainment America. 

#### How it all began:

My craze for gaming began at the tender age of 10, ever since I got my hands on my first PC powered by a Pentium mmx chip. I started learning programming languages like LOGO,BASIC, JAVA, and C/ C++. My interest in computers led me to successfully complete my Bachelors in Computer Science and Technology.My final year project was making a game in which the player controls a ball using gestures.

My passion in the field encouraged me to pursue my Masters in Entertainment technology at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. I had the opportunity to learn a lot about prototyping in the **“Building Virtual Worlds”** class taught by Jesse Schell and MK Haley. I worked on a variety of platforms like the Kinect,Wii-mote, HMD, etc.

In my second semester, I worked on a project called **“Strike Fortress”** for Electronic Arts at Redwood Shores, CA. Strike fortress was a tower defense WebGL game written entirely in Javascript.

My summer internship was at Game Closure. Here i worked on android games using the Game Closure SDK and Game Engine.

During the second year of my master’s course, I worked on two projects with Sony Computer Entertainment America. The first one was about 4 prototypes on Playstation Vita using the Playstation Mobile SDK. The second one was a co-op project at the Sony Foster City Campus.

#### Entwined And Pixelopus:

Soon after the co-op project, the Pixelopus Studio was formed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The 13-person team comprised of Carnegie Mellon graduates including myself, and veterans from the gaming industry. We released Entwined after just 10 months of development.

**Entwined** was a unique game which had a philosophical touch to the story. Combined with amazing visuals and music, it was a mesmerizing experience. It was released on PS4, PS3 and Vita. You can find more details about this in the projects section. We also released a mobile version called **"Entwined Challenge"**, which is currently available on the IOS and android app stores.

To sum up, I love prototyping new gameplay concepts and making different types of Game AI. I am also interested in exploring non-game AI as well including Deep Learning and its applications.
I also enjoy working with optimization process and I’m always in the pursuit of optimized code (both data structures and algorithms).
